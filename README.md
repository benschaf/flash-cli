# Flash-CLI: Command-Line Vocabulary Training

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Flash-CLI is a Python-based command-line vocabulary training application that seamlessly integrates with Google Sheets. Enhance your language skills, track progress, and master new wordsâ€”all from your terminal.

## UX

### User Stories

### Flowchart

### Why the Terminal?
The terminal is an ideal environment for vocabulary training for several reasons:

- **Focus on Learning:** By removing distractions (fancy UI elements, animations, etc.), the terminal allows users to concentrate solely on expanding their vocabulary.
- **Efficiency:** Terminal apps are lightweight and fast. Users can quickly launch the app, practice, and exit, thereby maximizing their time spent learning. 
- **Keyboard-Centric Interaction:** Terminal apps encourage keyboard shortcuts and efficient navigation, which aligns well with learning and memorization.

_Note_: For this specific project, the terminal environment is emulated within a browser. However, the app is designed to be used in a traditional terminal environment.

## Features

### Quiz Modes
#### Flashcard Mode: Users can review flashcards and decide if they know the answer.
#### Typed Answer Quizzes: Users type their answers directly.

### Real-Time Google Sheets Sync
#### Automatically update your vocabulary data in a connected Google Sheets document.

### Error Handling and Logging
#### Gracefully handle unexpected errors (e.g., invalid input, network issues).

## Future Features

### Quiz Modes
#### Multiple-Choice Quizzes: Randomized questions with answer choices.
#### Timed Quizzes: Set a time limit for answering questions.

### Flashcard Management
#### Create, edit, and delete flashcards.
#### Tag flashcards for better categorization.
#### Organize flashcards into decks or collections.

### Spaced Repetition
#### Implement a spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., Leitner system) to optimize learning intervals.
#### Gradually increase intervals for well-remembered words.
#### Remind users to review flashcards at optimal times.

### Statistics and Analytics
#### Display overall progress (e.g., percentage of mastered words).
#### Show performance trends over time (graphs, charts).
#### Identify areas where improvement is needed (e.g., low success rate on specific flashcards).

### Import/Export
#### Import: Allow users to import existing vocabulary lists from other sources (e.g., Quizlet, Anki).
#### Export: Enable users to export flashcards (e.g., as CSV files) for sharing or backup.

### Error Handling and Logging
#### Log application events for debugging and troubleshooting.

### Interactive Help System
#### Provide built-in documentation accessible via commands (e.g., help, man).
#### Explain features, usage, and available commands.

### Integration with Language APIs
#### Use language APIs (e.g., WordNet, Google Translate) for:
- Synonyms and antonyms
- Example sentences
- Word definitions
- Pronunciations

### Gamification
#### Points and Badges: Reward users with points for completing quizzes or achieving milestones.
#### Daily Streaks: Encourage consistent practice by maintaining daily streaks.

### Customizable Themes
#### Allow users to choose color schemes for the terminal interface (e.g., light mode, dark mode).

### Backup and Restore
#### Regularly back up user data (flashcards, progress) to prevent data loss.
- Provide an option to restore from backups if needed (e.g., after reinstalling the app).

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
