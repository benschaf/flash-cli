### Why the Terminal?
The terminal is an ideal environment for vocabulary training for several reasons:

- **Focus on Learning:** By removing distractions (fancy UI elements, animations, etc.), the terminal allows users to concentrate solely on expanding their vocabulary.
- **Efficiency:** Terminal apps are lightweight and fast. Users can quickly launch the app, practice, and exit, thereby maximizing their time spent learning.
- **Keyboard-Centric Interaction:** Terminal apps encourage keyboard shortcuts and efficient navigation, which aligns well with learning and memorization.

_Note_: For this specific project, the terminal environment is emulated within a browser. However, the app is designed to be used in a traditional terminal environment.

## Features

### Main Menu and Navigation
The app provides a main menu with options to choose between different quiz modes and to exit the app. Users can navigate the app using keyboard shortcuts that are displayed in the menu. If the user wishes to have more information about the options, they can use the help (?) command.
All invalid inputs are handled gracefully, and the app provides helpful messages to guide users.
![Main Menu](documentation/images/feature-main-menu.png)

### Flashcard Mode: Users can review flashcards and decide if they know the answer.
Functionality:
- Display a random flashcard only with the word (question).
- Upon user input, reveal the definition (answer).
- Prompt the user to indicate if they knew the answer or not.
- Update the flashcard status based on the user's response.
- Provide personalized feedback based on the user's responses and the responses of the community so far.
This mode is designed to help users for initial learning and self-assessment. It's a simple and effective way to memorize new flashcards.
![Flashcard Mode](documentation/images/feature-flashcard-mode.png)

### Typed Answer Quizzes: Users type their answers directly.
Functionality:
- Display a word (question).
- Prompt the user to type the definition (answer).
- Check the user's input against the correct definition.
- If the user's input is incorrect, display the correct definition and ask the user if they want to count their attempt as a success or failure.
- Update the flashcard status based on the user's responses.
- Provide personalized feedback based on the user's responses and the responses of the community so far.
This mode is designed to test the user's recall and understanding of the flashcard. It's a more challenging and interactive way to practice and reinforce learning.
![Typed Answer Mode](documentation/images/feature-typed-answer-mode.png)

### Real-Time Google Sheets Sync
The app automatically syncs flashcard data with a connected Google Sheets document using the Google Sheets API. No user login is required.

The Google Sheet is set up so that every worksheet is a deck of flashcards. Each row represents a flashcard, with the word in the first column and the definition in the second column. Further columns are used to store the status of the flashcard.
![Google Sheets](documentation/images/feature-google-sheets-sync.png)

### Real-Time Feedback:
The app will provide personalized and dynamically generated feedback based on collective performance. Feedback is given after answering most questions and at the end of each quiz. It's designed to motivate users and help put their progress into perspective.

Here are some examples of the feedback:
- "Great job! You're part of the 70% of people who knew the answer!"
- "You're doing better than 30% of people who attempted this flashcard."
- "You knew the answer! Great job!"
- "Don't worry, less than half of the people who attempted this flashcard knew the answer."
- "You're doing better than 40% of people who attempted this flashcard."
- "You wrote the correct answer! Great job!"
- "You're doing better than 20% of people who attempted this flashcard."
- "50% of people opted to treat the answer as correct or wrote it correctly. Keep practicing!"

### Error Handling and Logging
Flash-CLI gracefully handles unexpected errors and provides helpful messages to guide users. Additionally, the app logs application events for debugging and troubleshooting.

This is achieved using a custom built helper function:
```python
def handle_exception(e: Exception, message: str) -> NoReturn:
    """
    Handles an exception by printing an error message, logging the error,
    and exiting the program.

    Args:
        e (Exception): The exception that occurred.
        message (str): The error message to display.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    print(message)
    print(f"Error details: {e}")
    logging.exception(f"{message} Error details: %s", str(e))
    print("Quitting due to error.")
    sys.exit(1)
```

An example of how this function is called:
```python
try:
    # more code ...
    CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file("creds.json")
    # more code ...
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    handle_exception(e, "Failed to load 'creds.json'. Please ensure the file "
                     "exists in the same directory as this script.")
```

### Gracefully handle unexpected errors (e.g., invalid input).
Invalid input: If the user enters an invalid command or input, the app will display a helpful message and prompt the user to try again.

Example:

## Data Model

### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic,
and mapped out before coding began using a free version of [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io).

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the program.

### Classes & Functions

The program uses two classes as a blueprint for the project's objects (OOP).
The `Flashcard` class represents a single flashcard, and the `Flashcard_Set` class represents a set (deck) of flashcards.
A number of `Flashcard` objects are stored in a `Flashcard_Set` object.
The objects are created using the data from the Google Sheets document. In the document, a worksheet represents a `Flahscard_Set` and each row represents a `Flashcard`.

```python
class Flashcard:
    """
    A class to represent a flashcard.

    Attributes:
        question (str): The question on the flashcard.
        answer (str): The answer to the question on the flashcard.
        progress_dict (dict): A dictionary to track the
        progress of the flashcard.

    Methods:
        show_question(): Prints the question on the flashcard.
        show_answer(): Prints the answer to the question on the flashcard.
        update_progress(progress_key: str): Updates the
        progress of the flashcard.

    """
    def __init__(self, question: str, answer: str, progress_dict: dict):
        self.question = question
        self.answer = answer
        self.progress_dict = progress_dict

    def show_question(self) -> None:
        # function code
    def show_answer(self) -> None:
        # function code
    def update_progress(self, progress_key: str) -> None:
        # function code
```

```python
class Flashcard_Set:
    """
    A class to represent a set of flashcards.

    Attributes:
        title (str): The title of the flashcard set.
        flashcards (List[Flashcard]): The flashcards in the set.

    Methods:
        _load_flashcards(): Loads the flashcards from the worksheet data.
        show_all(): Displays all the flashcards in a table format.
        upload() -> None: Prepares the flashcard data and uploads it to the
        Google Sheets worksheet.

        Note: The methods above all use helper methods to perform their tasks.
        These helper methods are not listed here.
    """
    def __init__(self, title: str):
        """
        Initializes a Flashcard_Set object.
        Uses the load_flashcards method to load the flashcards from the
        worksheet data.
        """
        self.title = title
        self.flashcards = self._load_flashcards()

    def _load_worksheet_data(self) -> List[Dict[str, Union[int, float, str]]]:
        # ...
    def _create_flashcard_from_row(
            self,
            row: Dict[str, Union[int, float, str]]
    ) -> Flashcard:
        # ...
    def _load_flashcards(self) -> List[Flashcard]:
        # ...
    def show_all(self) -> None:
        # ...
    def _convert_to_list_of_lists(self) -> list[list]:
        # ...
    def _prepare_data_for_upload(self) -> list:
        # ...
    def _upload_data_to_worksheet(self, data: list) -> None:
        # ...
    def upload(self) -> None:
        # ...
```

The primary functions outside of the classes used on this application are:
- `pick_set()`: Allows the user to choose a set of flashcards to practice.
- `give_feedback_card()` and `give_feedback_set()`: Provides personalized feedback based on the user's performance and the community's performance.
- `pick_mode()`: Allows the user to choose between different quiz modes and other actions. This function is the main menu of the app.
- `flashcard_mode()`: The flashcard mode allows the user to review flashcards and decide if they know the answer.
- `typed_answer_mode()`: The typed answer mode allows the user to type their answers directly.

![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

---

Happy coding!
